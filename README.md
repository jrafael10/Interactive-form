# Interactive-form

This project is called an Interactive form. 

#  Requirements 
* Utilize jQuery while coding the functionality for the form.
* When the page first loads, the first text field should be in focus by default.
*  A text field that will be revealed when the "Other" option is selected from the "Job Role" drop down menu.
* For the T-Shirt "Color" menu, the color options that match the design selected in the "Design" menu are displayed.
* If the user selects "Theme - JS Puns" then the color menu should only display "Cornflower Blue," "Dark Slate Grey," and "Gold."
* If the user selects "Theme - I â™¥ JS" then the color menu should only display "Tomato," "Steel Blue," and "Dim Grey."
* When a new theme is selected from the "Design" menu, the "Color" field and drop down menu is updated.
* Some events are at the same day and time as others. 
  If the user selects a workshop,  selection of a workshop at the same day and time is not allowed -- checkbox is disabled and  there's a visual indication that the workshop in the competing time slot isn't available.
* When a user unchecks an activity, the competing activities (if there are any) are no longer disabled.
* As a user selects activities, a running total is displayed below the list of checkboxes.
  For example, if the user selects "Main Conference", then Total: $200 should appear. If they add 1 workshop, the total should change to Total: $300
